I have focused on optimizing processes related to Direct Material Index (DMI) by closely monitoring material usage and identifying areas for cost efficiency. My efforts have contributed to better resource management and alignment with our DMI targets. I remain committed to driving improvements in material efficiency moving forward."

Throughout the appraisal period, I have actively worked towards improving our Direct Material Index (DMI) by closely monitoring material usage and implementing cost-saving measures. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain and introduced solutions that have contributed to reducing material costs without compromising quality. By analyzing data and adjusting procurement strategies, I have helped align our material consumption with the organization's DMI targets. Moving forward, I am committed to continuing these efforts to further optimize material usage and support the company's cost-efficiency goals
